## 😽 〢 Info

DiscordLogsBot is a bot that logs all\
messages sent to all servers the bot is on,\
this can be used to keep track of messages\
from our server in case we need to check if someone\
sent something inappropriate/against the rules.\
I plan to add more functions such as just log\
messages from a specific role/channel.

## 🐱 〢 Extra

You can add commands if you want\
Just use ./cogs folder :3
